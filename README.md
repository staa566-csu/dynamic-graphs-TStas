## 2004 tsunami impact on Thailand

On December 26, 2004, an undersea earthquake off the coast of northern Indonesia caused a series of tsunami waves that impacted several countries in this region, including Thailand. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides data on this tsunami, among others, under the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), specifically the Natural Hazards subdivision. 

## Goal of this plot

The goal of this plot is to create a plot that shows the measurements of maximum water height (m) at various locations around Thailand. This will illustrate which regions of Thailand were impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and characterize the range of heights of tsunami waves observed in this region. The plot will convey the maximum 'max_water_height' per each Thailand location, and also convey how far the location was from the source of the tsunami (the undersea earthquake).
